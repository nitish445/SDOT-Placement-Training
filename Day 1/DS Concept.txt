Comparison of Arrays vs. Linked Lists

1. Storage and Memory Allocation:
   - Arrays:
       • Stored in contiguous memory locations.
       • Memory is allocated at compile time.
       • Fixed in size.
   - Linked Lists:
       • Not stored in contiguous memory locations.
       • Memory is allocated at run time.
       • Dynamic in size.

2. Memory Usage:
   - Arrays: Use less memory overall.
   - Linked Lists: Use more memory because each node stores both the data and a pointer (address) to the next node.

3. Element Access:
   - Arrays: Elements can be accessed directly (random access).
   - Linked Lists: Accessing an element requires traversal from the beginning of the list.

4. Insertion and Deletion Operations:
   - Arrays: Insertion and deletion operations are generally slower because elements may need to be shifted.
   - Linked Lists: Insertion and deletion operations are faster since only pointers need to be updated.
