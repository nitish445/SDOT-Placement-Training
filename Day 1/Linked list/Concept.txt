A linked list is a dynamic data structure made up of nodes. Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node, allowing efficient insertions and deletions.

Types of Linked Lists:

1. Singly Linked List:
   - Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.
   - Diagram:
     [Head] -> [Data | Next] -> [Data | Next] -> [Data | Next] -> None

2. Doubly Linked List:
   - Each node contains data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node.
   - Diagram:
     None <- [Data | Prev, Next] <-> [Data | Prev, Next] <-> [Data | Prev, Next] -> None

3. Circular Linked List:
   - The last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.
   - Diagram (Singly Circular):
     [Head] -> [Data | Next] -> [Data | Next] -> [Data | Next]
         ^                                   |
